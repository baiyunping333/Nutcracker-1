Before building this program you will need to install the following
progams/packages:

    *) gfortran
    *) CMake (http://www.cmake.org/)
    *) Boost >= 1.45 (http://www.boost.org)
    *) yaml-cpp (http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/)
    *) BLAS/LAPACK
       [Already included in OSX.]
    *) ARPACK (http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/)
       [If you are using OSX, the version available online will cause segfaults
        because gfortran and OSX disagree over how a call to ZDOTC/U should
        work.  I have included a version patched to fix this problem in the file
	dependencies/arpack-osx.tar.bz2.]

Nutcracker uses cmake for its build system.  To build it type the
following:

     cmake .
     make

This builds the program 'nutcracker' in the programs/ subdirectory.
If you want to install Nutcracker, type:

     make install

If you want to build and run the test suite you will need to first
check out the sources for the Illuminate test library from:

    http://github.com/gcross/Illuminate

and build and install them using the same sequence of commands
(i.e. cmake . && make && make install)
